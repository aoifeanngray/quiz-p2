### Future Features: 
- more quizes available on the site. 
- leaderboard and login for users to track progress. 

## Testing and Validating:
- The site has been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience by creating media queries in the CSS file. Throughout my testing of the screen sizing for each page I had to go back through and change some size values in order to have them formatted to work correctly.

- On completion of my testing, I then put my code through validators to ensure my code was up to standard, to identify error so they can be corrected. I used the W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw Validator for CSS.

## JSHint results: 
## Main page
### Error 1:
-  Semi Colons missing. This is true but these are not mandatory to include in JS as you can see in the below research. They tend to slow down the movement of the page.

## Other testing:
- ensuring when buttons clicked they respond. 

## Deployment: 
### To create the website: 
First I began by using the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template.

Secondly, I had to then 'create a new repository' using the template.
I gave it a repo name, then clicked create repository. 
From there I clicked the green 'Gitpod' button to begin my coding. 

### How I committed my work throughout the project:

- git add .  - I typed this into the terminal to add the files to the staging area. 
- git commit -m "explaining the updates" - I typed this command into the terminal to commit changes to the local repository. 
- git push - this pushes all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

## To publish the site link:
- Login to GitHub, go to your Repository.

- Go to the "Settings" Button on the menu and down to the 'pages' option. 

- Go to "Source", change to "Main".

- Click Save and then back into the pages section to find your published link for the site.
